<h1>Basic Quadratic Equation Calculator</h1>

This python program is a basic quadratic equation calculator. It takes three values and produces two values for x. It is based of the quadratic formula. The program imports two modules, math and cmath, that are used in two independent functions for each x value the quadratic forumla produces. Each function uses a try/execpt block to deal with imaginary numbers. Finally, I used a while loop to allow this program to continue to run as long as the user needs it. Check out the attached file for source code. You are free to downloand this script and run it your self.
